// AJAX
// help me pull the data and place it inside our application without having to refresh the page
// AJAX is a technique for accessing web servers from a web page
// AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML
// AJAX is not a programming language
// AJAX just uses a combination of:
// A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
// JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)
// AJAX is a misleading name. AJAX applications might use XML to transport data, but it is equally common to transport data as plain text or JSON text.
// AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.
